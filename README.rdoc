= ubiquitous_user

Many web applications required you to log in before being able to interact with
them; which poses a real barer of entry for new users. You need users to have
accounts for many tasks, but you don't need those accounts to be any more than
an id. No username, no password, no profile.

This library is an implementation of that. You add the Usable mixin to your
ApplicationController and after that call user to get a user, or user! to get a
user that exists on the database (it'll be stored if needed).

When a user log ins what you have to do is set the user, which is just doing
user = userObject.

This library also provides an authorize method, to use as a filter for those
actions that really require a logged in user.

An important consideration is that users should be mergeable now. If you have
a user with an account, and that user comes back a month latter, he may start
to operate your site with the new ghost account and only log in latter on. At
that moment the ghost account and the real account will be merged, basically by
calling real_account.merge(ghost_account_id)

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
